# see minor mode

Edit string in a separate file  with appropriate major mode enabled in
it.  Currently only support cc-mode and string containing SQL code.

This is a work in progress, pull request are welcome!

## How to use

Use  `see-edit-src-at-point` to  edit  a literal  string (SQL  content
meantime).  You can use `C-x s` to  update content back and `C-c '` to
save and exit from see minor mode.
